# Playlist Prediction Project

We're taking a crack at using predictive modeling to generate personalized playlists for listening services like Spotify, Apple music, Youtube Music, etc. using a blend of listener song preferences and new recommendations. We aim to: 1) create a model that can predict upcoming tracks in listener-curated playlists using the Spotify Million Playlist Dataset and 2) tweak this model to incorporate additional track-specific features that are not included in the dataset, such as genre, mood, lyrical content etc. Hopefully, we end up with a model that can strike a balance between listeners' song picks and the "vibes" of the songs in their list.
